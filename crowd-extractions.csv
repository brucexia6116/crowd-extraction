There were no differences between the groups in any of the preoperative measurements, the duration of operation, operative blood loss or transfusion requirement. The RL group required 9.5 liters of fluid intraoperatively as compared with 6.3 liters required by the HSL group (p less than 0.01). There was no significant difference between the groups in the amount of sodium infused to achieve resuscitation or in the sodium balance at the end of the study period. Hypernatremia (average maximum serum sodium: 157 milliequivalents per liter) and hyperosmolarity (average maximum serum osmolarity: 320 milliosmoles per liter) resolved in the HSL group within 48 hours. Correction of the hyperosmolar state was thought to be due to the judicious administration of free water and a decrease in renal free water clearance. The HSL group required significantly greater potassium administration during the early postoperative period due to increased kaluresis. HSL is safe and effective for use in the resuscitation of moderate blood volume deficit. Changes in serum sodium values and in osmolarity resolve rapidly.

Various treatments have been suggested but no controlled trial has ever been performed. Medical treatment has included anticoagulant or platelet antiaggregant therapy. Surgical correction has been proposed for selected patients who have failed medical therapy. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty and stenting have been increasingly used in some patients, although long-term results are unknown. The objective of the study was to review our recent experience with the management and outcome of extracranial CCAD. We identified 27 patients with extracranial CCAD who were evaluated, treated and/or followed by our Stroke Service from September 1995 to August 2001. Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, management, and outcome were reviewed. There were 15 men (56%) and 12 women (44%) with mean ages of 38 and 43 years respectively. Diagnosis was made by cerebral angiography in 15 (56%) patients and by MRI/MRA only in 12 (44%) patients. Twenty-two patients had spontaneous and five had traumatic extracranial CCAD. Most common associated disorders were arterial hypertension (37%) and migraine (26%). One patient presented only with a painful post-ganglionic Horner syndrome, another patient with neck pain and post-ganglionic Horner syndrome, another patient solely with protracted unilateral headaches, three with transient ischemic attacks (TIA), and 21 with ischemic strokes. The internal carotid artery (ICA) was the most frequently involved vessel (63%), followed by the vertebral artery (30%, and multivessel involvement in two patients (7%). Eighteen patients received anticoagulant therapy and nine platelet anti-aggregants. Follow-up extended from 2 to 115 months, with a mean of 58 months. At the end of follow-up, 23 (85%) patients had either no disability or only minor sequelae (modified Rankin score: 0 to 1), and four (15%) patients had moderate limitations (modified Rankin score: 2 to 3). Two patients had a recurrent ischemic stroke, one unrelated to recurrent CCAD, and the other following percutaneous balloon angioplasty/stenting for treatment of a persistent vertebral artery pseudoaneurysm. Most CCAD involved the extracranial ICA. The clinical presentation is variable, most patients having an ischemic stroke or TIAs.

The pattern of the hemodynamic parameters and tissue oxygenation values during the dissection and anhepatic stages were similar in both groups At the first unclamping, initial portal revascularization produced higher values of mean pulmonary pressure (25 +/- 7 mm of Hg vs. 17 +/- 4 mm of Hg; P < 0.05) and wedge and central venous pressures.

The pattern of the hemodynamic parameters and tissue oxygenation values during the dissection and anhepatic stages were similar in both groups At the first unclamping, initial portal revascularization produced higher values of mean pulmonary pressure (25 +/- 7 mm of Hg vs. 17 +/- 4 mm of Hg; P < 0.05) and wedge and central venous pressures. At the second unclamping, initial portal revascularization produced higher values of cardiac output and mean arterial pressure (87 +/- 15 mm of Hg vs. 79 +/- 15 mm of Hg; P < 0.05) and pulmonary blood pressure. Postreperfusion syndrome was present in 13 patients (42.5%) in the arterial group and in 11 patients (36%) in the portal group. During revascularization, the values of gastric and arterial pH decreased in both groups and recovered at the end of the procedure, but were more accentuated in the initial arterial revascularization group. In conclusion, we found that initial arterial revascularization of the graft increases pulmonary pressure less markedly, so it may be indicated for those patients with poor pulmonary and cardiac reserve.

However, the infusion of even limited amounts of HES solution during the anhepatic period may result in a worsening coagulopathy. Moreover, lactate-containing HES solution may cause some degree of biochemical derangements in compromised recipients. Therefore, we compared two different types of HES solutions: a balanced salt-based high molecular weight HES solution (670/0.75; high MW group) and a saline-based low molecular weight HES solution (130/0.4; low MW group) with respect to coagulation and biochemical profiles. First, in an in vitro study (n = 48), thromboelastography was performed to determine the effects of two HES solutions on coagulation after diluting (11%) the recipient's blood sample with each HES solution. Second, in an in vivo study, 500 ml of one of the two 6% HES solution was administered to 74 recipients (n = 37, each group) for 30 min after starting the anhepatic period. The coagulation profiles, including thromboelastography, and biochemical profiles were measured before and 30 min after the end of infusion. Less impairment in the thromboelastography profiles and aPTT was observed in the high MW group. A higher calcium concentration and less reduction in platelet count were noted in the high MW group, but lactate accumulation was greater.
